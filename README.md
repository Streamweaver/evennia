Overview
========

This is a repository to autobuild an evennia image in Docker Hub.

See the Dockerfile for more details, there isn't much to it here as this is just a base image for evennnia.  Expectations are that I would use this as a base for a different game image.

Note that Evennia does not use tagged releases in their github repo so this will make tagged docker images difficult.  Note the date on image builds if you have any question.
